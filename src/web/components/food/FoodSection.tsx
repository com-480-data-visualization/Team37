        `We will first explore trade of food through some unique edge cases. In "food" we include all HS92 categories (18) that are related to human nutrition. The grouping is broad and includes categories like meat and fish, vegetables and fruits, and, crucially, cereals like wheat and rice.
        
        Yemen is a country of 39.39 million people that has great difficulty producing its own food due to severe water scarcity, poor land quality, and war.
        As a result, Yemen imports a large part of the food it consumes and is currently facing food shortages and famine.

        We are trying to capture this external dependence by normalizing food imports to the total size of the country's economy (GDP).
        In 2023, Yemen food imports are equivalent to ~20% of its GDP and the percentage rose significantly after the 2014 civil and subsequent international wars.

        `In 2007, the Saudi government decreed that wheat production must fall by 12.5% year-over-year, with the objective of ending wheat cultivation in the country by 2016.
        
        Naturally, since wheat is a staple food ingredient in Saudi Arabia, the country is largely dependent on cereal imports. The 2007 decision, which is in contrast to the kingdom's 1980s policy of wheat self-sufficiency, was made to protect the country's scarce water reserves.

        Below, we illustrate the rapid growth in cereal imports.

A broader water crackdown followed: green-fodder crops were banned in December 2015, the prohibition taking full effect on 5 November 2018. That same day, the government eased up slightly, offering small farmers subsidised contracts for up to 1.5 million tons of wheat a year. By 2023/24 the revival had lifted output to about 1.2 million tons, but Saudi grain needs still hinge on world markets—and on whichever policy pivot comes next.",

        Cereal (mostly wheat) exports were almost zero after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
        
        Not without the occasional volatility, Ukraine emerged as the supplier of ~10% of the worlds cereal exports in terms of weight.
        Despite the 2022 war and naval blockade threatening Ukraine's export industry and the food stability of the planet, Ukraine's contribution to food availability has remained relatively stable.
